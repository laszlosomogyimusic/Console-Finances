# Bootcamp Module 4 Challenge - Console-Finances
## Description
In this project we start to use JavaScript basics. The end result is displayed in the console, so please use the browser's developer tools to see the results.

## Tasks
My task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
    * I need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.
    * The Equation for that is: ```Total/(Number of months - 1)```
 * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
 * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
